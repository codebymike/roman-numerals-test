# Roman Numerals

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M

1  => I
10  => X
7  => VII

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each
digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any
digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII
