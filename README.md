# Roman Numerals

Write a function which converts normal numbers into Roman Numerals.

---

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M 
e.g:
  - 1  => I
  - 10  => X
  - 7  => VII

The largest number which might need converting is 3000.

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each
digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any
digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

  - 1000=M
  - 900=CM
  - 90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

  - 2000=MM
  - 8=VIII
